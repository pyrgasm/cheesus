            <h1>Hey I'm Pyrgasm and this website runs on Go Net backend ðŸ’¨ðŸ˜®</h1>
            <p>This website was coded by me from the ground up no frameworks were used, just pure html and css... and some js. The reason this website even exist is that ive found an exploit in how the coupon codes are generated at mcdonalds so then i created an Android app in like 2hours it worked fine but i thought app is kinda meh no one gon install that shit, plus google now says its infected LeL its not i didnt even release it publicly i just sent it to few friends. I guess google now just flags everything thats not from Play Store ðŸ™„. Kay read the full story if you don't have anything better to do ðŸšŽ</p>
